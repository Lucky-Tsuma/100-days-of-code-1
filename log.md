# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 13, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I have completed a challenge on Frontend Mentor

**Thoughts** Took long to complete the challenge. Probably because I haven't been practising on my CSS lately. Great working with bootstrap to make the page responsive.

### Day 3: June 15, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I have done exercises to practice on CRUD operations using mongoose.

**Thoughts** Just realised that mongoose database tools have to be installed separately on windows. Finished the tutorial by checking up on updating and deleting documents using mongoose.
