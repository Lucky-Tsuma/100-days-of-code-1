### Day 5: June 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Did an exercise to practice on data validation using mongoose. Restructured project so each module handles a specific task.

### Day 11: June 23, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did exercises to practice on modelling relationships between related data on mongodb. Also looked at the fawn library. 

**Thoughts** The [fawn library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fawn) used to handle transcations in mongodb is exciting an worth exploring. Really good concept. Also had an indepth look at the ***ObjectId*** property used in mongodb documents and what king of data it holds.
Also learnt how to use joi to validate objectId for mongodb using [joi-objectid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi-objectid)
