# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 13, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I have completed a challenge on Frontend Mentor

**Thoughts** Took long to complete the challenge. Probably because I haven't been practising on my CSS lately. Great working with bootstrap to make the page responsive.

### Day 5: June 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Did an exercise to practice on data validation using mongoose. Restructured project so each module handles a specific task.

**Thoughts** Modularization makes code cleaner and easier to maintain. Grasping concepts even better especially asynchronous javascript and routing.
